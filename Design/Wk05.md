# Wk05

Hours: 19

## Goals:
- Start prototyping Room Database
- Finish Diagrams
- Begin refining prototype features
  - Ingredients & Packages
  -

## Optional Cross-device sync research for Room (Not realistic within the time period):
- No auto-increment IDs (use UUID)
- Tables should have timestamps for updates
- Soft delete (Tombstones) using is_deleted flag
- Tombstone pruning after a given amount of time using delete_at: Timestamp flag.

## Considerations:
- UUIDS mean that recipe names can be duplicated. Consider how to maintain unique recipe names as well
-

## Room Setup
- Device specific code (boilerplate to create and interact with the database)
- @Entity tags on objects
- @Dao objects
- @Database singleton object to extend and interact with the database
- @Typeconverters to convert kotlin objects to primitive types
